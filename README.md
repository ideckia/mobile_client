# ideckia

Mobile client for [ideckia](http://github.com/ideckia/ideckia). This app only shows the server state and executes actions in the server when clicked elements. Really nothing happens in this app, basically is a remote control.

## Log view

Touch the screen with three fingers to show the log. In this view there are to buttons in the top-right corner:

* Go to insert the IP manually (![](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/google-material-design-icons/48/ic_dehaze_48px-48.png) button).
* Reload the app (![](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/google-material-design-icons/48/ic_autorenew_48px-48.png) button).
